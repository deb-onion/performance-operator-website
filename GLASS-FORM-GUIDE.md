import { GlassForm } from '@/components/ui/GlassForm';
```

2. Replace your existing form JSX:
```tsx
<GlassForm
  title="Your Custom Title"
  subtitle="Your custom subtitle"
/>
```

### Add to Landing Page

```tsx
<section className="py-24 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100">
  <Container>
    <GlassForm
      title="Start Your Project"
      subtitle="Tell us about your goals and we'll create a custom solution."
    />
  </Container>
</section>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Background Choice**: Use backgrounds with good contrast for readability
2. **Positioning**: Center the form or use it in a dedicated section
3. **Spacing**: Provide adequate padding around the form
4. **Mobile**: Test on mobile devices to ensure proper responsiveness

## Form Submission

The form currently simulates submission. To connect it to your backend, modify the `handleSubmit` function in `components/ui/GlassForm.tsx`.

## Browser Support

The glass form uses modern CSS features and is supported in all modern browsers. For older browsers, it gracefully degrades while maintaining full functionality.

## Styling Customization

### Background Variations

The component automatically adapts to different backgrounds. For best results, use:

- Light gradient backgrounds (blue, purple, indigo tones)
- Dark backgrounds with good contrast
- Image backgrounds with overlay

### Custom Styling

You can add custom classes to modify the appearance:

```tsx
<GlassForm
  className="max-w-lg mx-auto shadow-2xl"
  title="Custom Form"
/>
```

### CSS Variables

The component uses these CSS classes that you can customize:

```css
/* Glass container */
.backdrop-blur-lg /* Main blur effect */
.bg-white/30 /* Background transparency */
.border-white/20 /* Border transparency */

/* Input fields */
.bg-white/10 /* Input background */
.border-white/20 /* Input border */
.focus:bg-white/20 /* Focus state */
```

## Troubleshooting
